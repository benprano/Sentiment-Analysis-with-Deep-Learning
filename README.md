# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning

In this project, I built Neural Networks with Keras that do a binary classification on the sentiment of imdb movie reviews and a multiclass classification on the sentiment of the reuters dataset.

I also wrote a corresponding blog-post about the imdb-project on my blog: https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/03/25/how-to-build-a-neural-network-with-keras/


To see the imdb-project, just open the Jupyter Notebook: ["imdb_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/imdb_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb). Alternatively, you can run the ["imdb.py"](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/imdb.py) file on your own computer if you have Keras and Numpy installed. 


To see the reuters-project, just open the Jupyter Notebook: ["Reuters_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/Reuters_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb). Alternatively, you can run the ["reuters.py"](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/reuters.py) file on your own computer if you have Keras and Numpy installed.
